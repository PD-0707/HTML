This is Priyadarshini , currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai. I have chosen the path of Electronics and Computer Engineering. I am very happy to choose this course and dwell into the ocean of technologies. Though, I had interest on Computer Science, currently I am learning on Web Development , still more to go but this is my first step of the process.
